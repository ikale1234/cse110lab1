# Ishaan's Web Page
## Introduction
I am Ishaan, a second year computer science major at *Marshall College*. I am from the Bay Area, I have a brother and a dog. On my free time I like playing **basketball** and **badminton**.
> I hope this class goes well !

## Programming background

The languages I am familiar with include Python, Java, JavaScript/HTML, C, C++, C#.

If I had to make a top 3 for these languages it would be:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Java

My favorite language is python due to the simple syntax and easy type switching

```
one = 1
two = '2'
three = False
```

You can take a look at some of the projects I've done [here](https://github.com/ikale1234).


## Very important section

Some interesting facts about this person above include:

When I woke up this morning, these are the tasks I completed

- [x] wake up
- [ ] wash my face
- [x] look at the image I linked above
